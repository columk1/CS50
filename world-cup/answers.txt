Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Incorrect predictions were common until around N = 1000, but results were not consistent until N = 10000.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
At N = 10000 the results became quite consistent, I would be happy there.
