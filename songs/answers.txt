1. I would characterize their Aura as Passionate and Energetic due to the high average energy, danceability and loudness scores of their top 100 and a valence in the middle of the range which suggests a balance of positive and negative songs.
2. High scores in energy, danceability and loudness could be a trend in the music of that year or of certain popular genres and might not be representative of any particular sentiment of the listener. A better way of calculating the aura might be to control for the trends in energy, loudness, danceability and valence in these genres. The user could be listening to lower valence and lower danceability songs than the control values from that year's popular songs in those genres which could give them an Angry or a Rebelious aura.
